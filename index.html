              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
              in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every pennyâ€™s worth.

              &quot; I&nbsp;was an&nbsp;EMT for many years before&nbsp;I joined the bootcamp. I&rsquo;ve been looking
              to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;transition and have heard some people who had an&nbsp;amazing&nbsp;experience here.
              I&nbsp;signed up&nbsp;for the free intro course and found it&nbsp;incredibly fun! I&nbsp;enrolled shortly
              thereafter. The next 12&nbsp;weeks was the best&nbsp;&mdash; and most grueling&nbsp;&mdash; time
              of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. Since completing the course, I&rsquo;ve successfully switched careers, working
              as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Software Engineer at&nbsp;a&nbsp;VR startup. &quot;

              Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
              learning from their experiences was easy.

              &quot; Before joining the bootcamp, I&rsquo;ve never written a&nbsp;line of&nbsp;code. I&nbsp;needed some
              structure from
              professionals who can help me&nbsp;learn programming step by&nbsp;step. I&nbsp;was encouraged
              to&nbsp;enroll by&nbsp;a&nbsp;former
              student of&nbsp;theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
              staff
              did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and&nbsp;I never had to&nbsp;wait long for assistance. The
              agile team
              project, in&nbsp;particular, was outstanding. It&nbsp;took my&nbsp;learning to&nbsp;the next level
              in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that no&nbsp;tutorial
              could ever have. In&nbsp;fact, I&rsquo;ve often referred to&nbsp;it&nbsp;during interviews
              as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example of&nbsp;my&nbsp;developent
              experience. It&nbsp;certainly helped me&nbsp;land a&nbsp;job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;full-stack developer after
              receiving multiple offers.
              100% recommend! &quot;
