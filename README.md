## My Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5**
- **CSS Grid**
- **Responsive Design**

### What I Learned

This project helped me:

1. Practice **CSS Grid layout** techniques to create a flexible and responsive grid.
2. Understand how to align and position elements dynamically using **grid-template-areas** and **grid-template-columns/rows**.
3. Identify areas where I still struggle to make designs **pixel-perfect**, which is an area I aim to improve in future projects.

### Continued Development

I want to focus on:

1. Improving my ability to achieve pixel-perfect designs.
2. Deepening my knowledge of advanced **CSS Grid** techniques.
